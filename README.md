# 🕵️‍♂️ Anomaly Detection in Insurance Claims

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook focused on detecting fraudulent insurance claims using advanced anomaly detection techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models aimed at identifying anomalous (potentially fraudulent) patterns.

## 📊 Project Overview

Fraud detection in insurance is a critical task with a direct impact on financial losses and claim processing efficiency. This project:

- Handles real-world insurance claims data
- Identifies outliers and suspicious patterns
- Implements anomaly detection using statistical methods and machine learning
- Provides visualization for better interpretability
